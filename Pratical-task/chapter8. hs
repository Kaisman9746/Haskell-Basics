-- Create type synonyms
type Address = String
type Value   = Int

-- Define the generateTx function
generateTx :: Address -> Address -> Value -> String
generateTx fromAddr toAddr amount =
    "From: " ++ fromAddr
    ++ ", To: " ++ toAddr
    ++ ", Amount: " ++ show amount

-- Main function to test it
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn (generateTx "Alice" "Bob" 50)

Output:
From: Alice, To: Bob, Amount: 50


-- Step 1: Define the PaymentMethod type
data PaymentMethod = Cash | Card | Cryptocurrency
    deriving Show   -- This allows us to print the payment method easily

-- Step 2: Define the Person type
-- A Person has a name (String), an address (tuple of String and Int), and a payment method
data Person = Person
    { name          :: String
    , address       :: (String, Int)
    , paymentMethod :: PaymentMethod
    }

-- Step 3: Create a person named Bob who pays with Cash
bob :: Person
bob = Person
    { name = "Bob"
    , address = ("Main Street", 12)
    , paymentMethod = Cash
    }

-- Step 4: Main function to print Bob's details
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("Name: " ++ name bob)
    putStrLn ("Address: " ++ fst (address bob) ++ ", House No: " ++ show (snd (address bob)))
    putStrLn ("Payment Method: " ++ show (paymentMethod bob))
