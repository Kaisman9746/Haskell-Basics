-- Create type synonyms
type Address = String
type Value   = Int

-- Define the generateTx function
generateTx :: Address -> Address -> Value -> String
generateTx fromAddr toAddr amount =
    "From: " ++ fromAddr
    ++ ", To: " ++ toAddr
    ++ ", Amount: " ++ show amount

-- Main function to test it
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn (generateTx "Alice" "Bob" 50)

Output:
From: Alice, To: Bob, Amount: 50


-- Step 1: Define the PaymentMethod type
data PaymentMethod = Cash | Card | Cryptocurrency
    deriving Show   -- This allows us to print the payment method easily

-- Step 2: Define the Person type
-- A Person has a name (String), an address (tuple of String and Int), and a payment method
data Person = Person
    { name          :: String
    , address       :: (String, Int)
    , paymentMethod :: PaymentMethod
    }

-- Step 3: Create a person named Bob who pays with Cash
bob :: Person
bob = Person
    { name = "Bob"
    , address = ("Main Street", 12)
    , paymentMethod = Cash
    }

-- Step 4: Main function to print Bob's details
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("Name: " ++ name bob)
    putStrLn ("Address: " ++ fst (address bob) ++ ", House No: " ++ show (snd (address bob)))
    putStrLn ("Payment Method: " ++ show (paymentMethod bob))

Output:

Name: Bob
Address: Main Street, House No: 12
Payment Method: Cash


-- Step 1: Define the Shape type
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float
    deriving Show  -- allows us to print shapes if needed

-- Step 2: Define the area function
area :: Shape -> Float
area shape =
    case shape of
        Circle r      -> 3.14 * r * r       -- area of a circle = π * r^2
        Rectangle w h -> w * h              -- area of a rectangle = width * height

-- Step 3: Main function to calculate and print areas
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let myCircle = Circle 5            -- circle with radius 5
    let myRectangle = Rectangle 10 5  -- rectangle with width 10 and height 5

    putStrLn ("Area of Circle with radius 5: " ++ show (area myCircle))
    putStrLn ("Area of Rectangle 10 x 5: " ++ show (area myRectangle))

Output:
Area of Circle with radius 5: 78.5
Area of Rectangle 10 x 5: 50.0

-- Step 1: Define the Employee type using record syntax
data Employee = Employee
    { name :: String
    , experienceInYears :: Float
    } deriving Show   -- allows printing Employee easily

-- Step 2: Create an employee named Richard
richard :: Employee
richard = Employee
    { name = "Richard"
    , experienceInYears = 7.5
    }

-- Step 3: Main function to print Richard's details
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("Employee Name: " ++ name richard)
    putStrLn ("Experience (years): " ++ show (experienceInYears richard))

Output:

Employee Name: Richard
Experience (years): 7.5



data Person = Person
    { name       :: String
    , age        :: Int
    , isEmployed :: Bool
    } deriving Show

person1 :: Person
person1 = Person
    { name = "John"
    , age = 28
    , isEmployed = True
    }

person2 :: Person
person2 = Person
    { name = "Mary"
    , age = 25
    , isEmployed = False
    }

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("Person1 Name: " ++ name person1)
    putStrLn ("Person1 Age: " ++ show (age person1))
    putStrLn ("Person1 Employed: " ++ show (isEmployed person1))
    
    putStrLn ("Person2 Name: " ++ name person2)
    putStrLn ("Person2 Age: " ++ show (age person2))
    putStrLn ("Person2 Employed: " ++ show (isEmployed person2))

Output:
Person1 Name: John
Person1 Age: 28
Person1 Employed: True
Person2 Name: Mary
Person2 Age: 25
Person2 Employed: False

data Shape
    = Circle  { center :: (Float, Float), radius :: Float, color :: String }
    | Rectangle { width :: Float, height :: Float, color :: String }
    deriving Show

myCircle :: Shape
myCircle = Circle { center = (0,0), radius = 5, color = "Red" }

myRectangle :: Shape
myRectangle = Rectangle { width = 10, height = 5, color = "Blue" }

main :: IO ()
main = do
    print myCircle
    print myRectangle
output 
Circle {center = (0.0,0.0), radius = 5.0, color = "Red"}
Rectangle {width = 10.0, height = 5.0, color = "Blue"}

output 
This is a dog named Buddy
This is a cat named Whiskers
